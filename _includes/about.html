<h2>About</h2>
Hello, my name is ↑, and I'm a web developer and general programmer living in Baltimore, MD. I make websites for work and for fun. Learning new libraries and technologies and implementing them to make interesting things is one of my favorite activities. When I’m not web developing my other interests include comic books, mathematics, and watching bad movies.
